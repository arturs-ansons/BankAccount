## Application description


Upon completing the registration process, users are directed to the clients portal. Within the Clients page, users have the option to open accounts denominated in EUR, USD, Investment, and BTC. Additionally, users are empowered to facilitate fund transfers in EUR and USD to other clients accounts. Furthermore, users can engage in the purchase of cryptocurrencies using their Investment(USD) account. It is pertinent to note that the functionality to sell BTC has not been implemented at present and visual indicator(color and percentage) is set to check only last purchase(additional functionality to be implemented).

In instances where a user initiates a currency transfer from EUR to USD accounts, the program will automatically calculate the applicable exchange rate. This feature ensures a seamless and transparent financial transaction experience for users.

Program has also variety of validations.

The client has the capability to assess the profitability of their BTC investments through a visual indicator. In the event of a profitable outcome, the BTC balance is presented in a green hue, whereas an unprofitable status is denoted by a red coloration. Additionally, the client is provided with a percentage representation illustrating the increment in the value of their investment in the BTC.
