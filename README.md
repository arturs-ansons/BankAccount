## Application description


Upon completing the registration process, users are directed to the clients portal. Within the Clients page, users have the option to open accounts denominated in EUR, USD, Investment, and Crypto currencies. Additionally, users are empowered to facilitate fund transfers in EUR and USD to other clients accounts. Furthermore, users can engage in the purchase of cryptocurrencies using their Investment(USD) account. It is pertinent to note that the functionality to sell cryptocurrencies has not been implemented at present.

In instances where a user initiates a currency transfer from EUR to USD accounts, the program will automatically calculate the applicable exchange rate. This feature ensures a seamless and transparent financial transaction experience for our users.


The client has the capability to assess the profitability of their cryptocurrency investments through a visual indicator. In the event of a profitable outcome, the cryptocurrency balance is presented in a green hue, whereas an unprofitable status is denoted by a red coloration. Additionally, the client is provided with a percentage representation illustrating the increment in the value of their investment in the specified currency.
