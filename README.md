## Application description


Upon completing the registration process, users are directed to the clients' portal. Within the Clients' page, users have the option to open accounts denominated in EUR, USD, INV, and Crypto currencies. Additionally, users are empowered to facilitate fund transfers in EUR and USD to other clients' accounts. Furthermore, users can engage in the purchase of cryptocurrencies using their USD accounts. It is pertinent to note that the functionality to sell cryptocurrencies has not been implemented at present.

In instances where a user initiates a currency transfer from EUR to USD accounts, the program will automatically calculate the applicable exchange rate. This feature ensures a seamless and transparent financial transaction experience for our users.
